# sblfonts – Font and language set up for Society of Biblical Literature style documents

The `sblfonts` package provides a LaTeX style for setting up font and language
support for documents conforming to the requirements of the Society of
Biblical Literature. Greek and Hebrew languages are supported using the SBL
fonts. If these fonts are not available then fonts included with TeXLive are
used.

## Installation from TeXLive or MiKTeX

The `sblfonts` package is distributed as part of the `sbltex` bundle and is in
TeXLive and MiKTeX. This bundle can be installed in the usual way through your
distribution. E.g., in TeXLive by running:

```
tlmgr install sbltex
```
