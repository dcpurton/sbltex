The text of the body of the paper is double-spaced except for blocked
quotations.
\begin{quote}
  This is a blocked quotation. It should consist of five or more lines of text
  and be indented one-half inch. Block quotations should be single-spaced. No
  quotation marks are used at the beginning or the end of the quote. Double
  quotation marks within the original matter are retained. The blocked quote
  is set off by a regular double space before and after the quote. Note that
  regular spacing resumes after the end of the quotation.
\end{quote}
After a block quotation, return to double-spaced text justified to the left
margin until you finish the paragraph.
