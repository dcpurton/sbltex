# sblidx – A LaTeX style for Society of Biblical Literature indices

The `sblidx` package provides a LaTeX style for creating indices in line with
the requirements of the Society of Biblical Literature. Indices for ancient
sources (via `bibleref-sbl`), modern authors (via `biblatex-sbl`) and subjects
are supported. Number ranges are compressed and indexed items in notes are
indicated using n. and nn.

TeXLive and MiKTeX. This bundle can be installed in the usual way through your
distribution. E.g., in TeXLive by running:
